# Skill: Question Framing

## Trigger Condition
Activate when an analytical question is vague, ambiguous, or missing decision context. Signs:
- The question is fewer than 10 words ("can you look at our data?")
- The question has no time period, no metric, or no population defined
- The question has no clear decision implied ("just explore")

## Purpose
Never start analysis without a framed question. An unframed question produces analysis that doesn't answer anything.

## Quick Framing Test
Before starting any analysis, verify you can answer all five questions:
1. **What metric** is being analyzed?
2. **What time period** is in scope?
3. **What population** does this apply to?
4. **What comparison** is being made? (vs. prior period, vs. target, vs. benchmark?)
5. **What decision** will this analysis inform?

If any of these is missing: stop and clarify before proceeding.

## Minimum Viable Frame
If you cannot get clarification (e.g., the user is not available), construct the minimum viable frame yourself from available context, state your assumptions explicitly, and proceed with that frame. Always flag it:
> "I've framed this as: [framed question]. I'm assuming [X, Y, Z]. Let me know if this isn't the right framing and I'll restart."

## Framing Formula
> "Among [population], during [time period], we want to understand why/how/whether [metric] [changed/is/compares] in order to decide [decision]."
