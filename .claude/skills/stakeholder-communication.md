# Skill: Stakeholder Communication

## Trigger Condition
Activate any time narrative is being written — headlines, body copy, recommendations, executive summaries, or verbal summaries for stakeholders.

## Core Communication Principles

### Lead with the insight, not the method
- ✅ "Maui was the only island with positive visitor growth in 2025"
- ❌ "After segmenting the visitor data by island and calculating YoY % change, we found that Maui showed positive growth while other islands did not"

The audience doesn't need to know how you found it. They need to know what you found.

### State the "so what" explicitly
Don't make the audience infer the implication. Tell them.
- ✅ "Hotel visitors drove O'ahu's decline — this means the recovery strategy should focus on hotel partnerships, not broad marketing spend"
- ❌ "Hotel visitors declined more than vacation rental visitors" (leaves the so-what implicit)

### Calibrate confidence language carefully

| Confidence level | Language to use |
|---|---|
| High (validated, large sample, strong signal) | "X declined 7%" / "The data shows..." |
| Medium (validated but smaller sample or noisy) | "The data suggests..." / "Based on available data..." |
| Low (directional only, data limitations) | "Preliminary data indicates..." / "This is directional — further validation needed" |
| Hypothesis (not yet validated) | "One hypothesis is..." / "We haven't confirmed this yet, but..." |

Never use high-confidence language for low-confidence findings.

### Audience calibration

| Audience | What they want | What to cut |
|---|---|---|
| Executive / C-suite | Bottom line up front; recommendation; confidence | Methodology; all intermediate findings |
| Product team | Root cause; segment detail; experiment design | Financial sizing (they'll ask for it) |
| Operations team | Specific actions; owners; timeline | Analytical nuance; confidence intervals |
| Data/analytics team | Methodology; data quality notes; caveats | Executive framing; business recommendations |

### Recommendation format
Always include all five fields for any recommendation:
```
Recommendation: [specific action]
Confidence: high / medium / low
Decision owner: [role or name]
Success metric: [specific metric and target]
Follow-up date: [date]
```

## Tone
- Direct, not aggressive
- Confident, not arrogant
- Specific, not vague
- Human, not robotic
- No corporate jargon: no "leverage," "synergy," "deep-dive," "actionable insights," "key takeaways," "circle back," "move the needle"
