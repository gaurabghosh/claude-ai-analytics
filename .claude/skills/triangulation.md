# Skill: Triangulation

## Trigger Condition
Activate before finalizing any key finding that will appear in the narrative. Any number that goes in the deck must be triangulated.

## Purpose
A finding confirmed by one method might be an artifact of that method. A finding confirmed by two independent methods is much more trustworthy. Triangulation is the habit of confirming important findings via multiple paths.

## What Triangulation Means in Practice

**For a metric value:**
- Calculate it two different ways (e.g., sum from transaction records AND from aggregate report)
- Do the numbers agree? If not, investigate the discrepancy before presenting either

**For a trend:**
- Confirm the trend exists in the raw data AND in a rolling average
- Confirm it appears in at least two segments, not just in one isolated group

**For a root cause:**
- Confirm via quantitative analysis (the number explains the gap)
- Confirm via directional plausibility (the mechanism makes sense)
- Ideally confirm via a third angle (e.g., timing aligns with a known event)

**For a recommendation:**
- Confirm the recommendation follows from the findings (analytical logic)
- Confirm the recommendation is actionable (practical logic)
- Confirm the recommendation doesn't conflict with known constraints (business logic)

## Minimum Bar
Every finding marked as a **headline** in the narrative must be confirmed by at least two independent methods before it is presented. Secondary findings need one confirmation.

## Triangulation Log
Document triangulation briefly in the validation report:
> "Revenue decline of -7.2% confirmed via: (1) sum of transaction records, (2) monthly aggregate report. Match within 0.1%."
