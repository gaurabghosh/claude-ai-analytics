# Narrative Copy: Amazon India Sales — The Discount Erosion Story

---

## Executive Summary

- Amazon India generated ₹642M in revenue across 10,000 orders between January 1 and February 10, 2026 — a ₹64,213 average order value.
- ₹112.9M was given away in discounts — 15% of the ₹754M gross potential — with no measurable impact on order volume or basket size.
- Orders receiving 20–30% discounts average ₹56K per order versus ₹71K for low-discount orders — a 21% gap — while ordering the same number of units (3.01 per order).
- 74% of revenue comes from Premium and Luxury price tiers (unit prices >₹25K). Budget items generate just 4% of revenue.
- **Capping the 20–30% discount tier at 10% recovers an estimated ₹23–39M — a 6.1% revenue lift with no new customers required.**

## Beat 1: Context

**Slide headline:** ₹642M in sales, 10,000 orders — January through mid-February 2026

**Body copy:** Amazon India processed 10,000 orders between January 1 and February 10, 2026, generating ₹642M in total revenue. Average order value was ₹64,213, with orders distributed evenly across Electronics, Home, and Fashion. This analysis covers the full order population — no filters applied. The financial metrics have been independently verified: total_sales = (unit price × quantity × (1 − discount)) + shipping.

**Speaker notes:** Set the context quickly. This slide is orientation, not analysis. The key thing to establish is scale and reliability: 10,000 clean orders, verified financials. The audience will want to see category breakdown next — give it to them on the following slide. Don't put numbers on this slide that you'll repeat on the next one.

## Beat 2: Context — Three categories, nearly identical share

**Slide headline:** No single category dominates — Electronics, Home, and Fashion are all within 2%

**Body copy:** Electronics leads at 34.2% of revenue (₹219M), followed by Home at 33.4% (₹215M) and Fashion at 32.4% (₹208M). The gap between first and last is 1.8 percentage points — effectively a three-way tie. Within categories, Furniture (₹112M) is the largest single sub-category, followed by Footwear and Clothing (both ₹104M). Laptop leads on average order value (₹67K), with all other sub-categories within ₹5K of that figure.

**Speaker notes:** The uniformity across categories is itself a finding worth flagging — it suggests either a deliberately balanced catalog strategy or that the data may reflect a broad-assortment platform with no concentration risk. The question this slide sets up is: if categories are equal, what IS creating revenue variation? The answer is discounting — which is where the tension begins.

## Beat 3: Tension — ₹113M walked out the door in discounts

**Slide headline:** One rupee in seven was discounted away before the sale closed

**Body copy:** Against ₹754M in gross potential revenue, Amazon India gave ₹112.9M in discounts — retaining 85 cents of every gross rupee. The average discount rate across all orders was 15.0%, applied uniformly across all categories and sub-categories. The discount structure runs from 0% to 30%, with orders distributed roughly equally across three tiers: 0–10%, 10–20%, and 20–30%.

**Speaker notes:** This is where the tension opens. The natural question from the audience will be: "Were those discounts necessary? Did they drive volume?" That's exactly what the next two slides answer. Don't pre-empt the answer here — let the audience lean into the question. The ₹113M number is large enough to land without commentary.

## Beat 4: Tension — Higher discounts don't move volume

**Slide headline:** Discount rate has no effect on units ordered — baskets stay at exactly 3 items

**Body copy:** Across every discount tier, the average number of items per order is 3.01. Orders receiving 0–10% discounts average 3.013 units. Orders receiving 20–30% discounts average 3.008 units. The maximum deviation across all buckets is 0.015 units — statistically indistinguishable from zero. Discounts are not inducing customers to add more items to their cart.

**Speaker notes:** This is the analytical turning point of the deck. Discounts would be defensible if they drove incremental volume — that's the classic justification for promotional pricing. But here, there is no incremental volume. The same customer who would have bought 3 items at 5% discount also buys 3 items at 28% discount. The price paid is just lower. This slide should land quietly but with impact — the chart tells the story without needing commentary.

## Beat 5: Tension — Each discount tier costs ₹6–9K per order

**Slide headline:** Deep discounts cut revenue per order by ₹15K — with nothing to show for it

**Body copy:** Average order value falls monotonically as discount depth increases: ₹71,006 at 0–10% discount, ₹64,342 at 10–20%, and ₹56,114 at 20–30%. That's a ₹14,892 drop — 21% lower revenue per order in the highest discount tier. The pattern holds in every category: Electronics, Fashion, and Home all show the same declining AOV curve. There is no segment where deep discounts sustain revenue per order.

**Speaker notes:** The Simpson's Paradox check has been run. The AOV decline is consistent across all three categories — it is not a mix effect. Someone might ask whether high-discount orders have higher unit prices that justify the discount (i.e., are we discounting expensive items?). The unit price distribution across discount buckets is similar — this is not a deliberate premium-item promotional strategy.

## Beat 6: Opportunity — ₹39M in recoverable revenue

**Slide headline:** Capping deep discounts at 10% recovers ₹23–39M without a single new customer

**Body copy:** The 3,162 orders currently receiving 20–30% discounts would generate ₹39.1M more revenue if repriced to 10% discount — assuming zero order loss. Under a conservative scenario (15% volume loss), the recovery is ₹33.2M. The base assumption is supported by the volume data: discount depth shows no correlation with order quantity, suggesting most demand in this tier is not discount-driven.

**Speaker notes:** The ₹39.1M is an upper-bound estimate. The real number depends on elasticity — how many of these customers would not have ordered at 10% discount. That is the key unknown. An A/B test is the right way to resolve it: hold the 20–30% discount on a control group, cap at 10% for the treatment group, and measure volume and revenue after 30 days. The base case of ₹33.2M is the recommendation's headline number.

## Beat 7: Opportunity — Premium is the growth engine, protect it

**Slide headline:** Three in four revenue rupees come from items priced above ₹25,000

**Body copy:** Premium (₹25K–₹40K unit price) and Luxury (>₹40K) segments together generate 74.2% of total revenue — ₹476.6M out of ₹642M — with above-average order values of ₹83K and ₹115K respectively. The Budget segment (<₹10K) generates only 4.1% of revenue. Deep discounting on high-ticket items accelerates the revenue erosion: a 25% discount on a ₹45K item costs ₹11.25K per unit before quantities compound.

**Speaker notes:** The implication here is asymmetric: the highest-value segment is also the most damage-prone from deep discounting. A 25% discount on a ₹500 item costs ₹125. The same discount rate on a ₹45,000 Laptop costs ₹11,250. The recommendation to eliminate deep discounts on Premium/Luxury items is therefore higher-priority than the same restriction on Budget items. This is where the policy should start.

## Beat 8: Resolution — Two decisions, one timeline

**Slide headline:** Cap deep discounts, test elasticity, and protect the premium segment

**Recommendation 1: Remove the 20–30% discount tier immediately for Premium and Luxury items**
- **Rationale:** These items drive 74% of revenue. Each percentage point of unnecessary discount on a ₹40K+ item costs ₹400–₹500 per unit. Volume data shows no elasticity. The cost of this change is low; the upside is high.
- **Decision owner:** Head of Pricing / Commercial Director
- **Success metric:** AOV for Premium/Luxury segment increases from ₹89K to ≥₹95K within 30 days of policy change
- **Timeline:** Policy update within 14 days; monitor weekly AOV for 30 days
- **Confidence:** Medium — elasticity for premium items assumed to be low based on volume data, but unconfirmed
- **Key risk:** If premium customers are discount-sensitive, volume could drop; monitor order count weekly

**Recommendation 2: Run a 30-day A/B test on the full 20–30% discount tier**
- **Rationale:** Resolve the elasticity question before a full rollout. Assign 50% of eligible orders to a 10% discount cap; measure volume and revenue vs the control group.
- **Decision owner:** Head of Growth / Analytics team
- **Success metric:** Test group revenue per order ≥₹68K (vs ₹56K control); volume loss <10%
- **Timeline:** Test design complete in 7 days; test runs 30 days; decision at day 37
- **Confidence:** High — this is designed to generate the evidence needed for full policy decisions
- **Key risk:** Sample size may be insufficient if 20–30% discount orders are not evenly distributed across categories; stratify the test by category

**Speaker notes:** The goal of this slide is two commitments: who is changing the pricing policy for premium items (Rec 1), and who is owning the A/B test design (Rec 2). Ask the room for both before closing. The analysis has done its job — the ₹33–39M recovery opportunity is on the table. The remaining work is resolving elasticity uncertainty through a controlled test.
