## Starting Observation (Layer 0)

## Layer-by-Layer Drill-Down

### Layer 1: What explains the ₹112.9M discount gap?

**Dimension tested:** Discount rate distribution across all orders

| Discount Bucket | Orders | % of Orders | Discount Given | AOV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0–10% | 3,492 | 34.9% | ₹13.6M | ₹71,006 |
| 10–20% | 3,346 | 33.5% | ₹39.4M | ₹64,342 |
| 20–30% | 3,162 | 31.6% | ₹60.0M | ₹56,114 |

**Layer 1 finding:** The 31.6% of orders in the 20–30% discount bucket alone account for ₹60M (53%) of total discounts given. These orders generate the lowest AOV in the dataset.

### Layer 2: Does the high-discount tier drive more units per order?

**Dimension tested:** Quantity per order across discount buckets

| Discount Bucket | Avg Units/Order |
|---|---|
| 0–10% | 3.013 |
| 10–20% | 3.022 |
| 20–30% | 3.008 |

**Layer 2 finding:** The 20–30% discount bucket has the same units per order as the 0–10% bucket (within 0.015 units). Discounting is NOT driving additional volume — it is only reducing the price at which existing demand is fulfilled.

---

### Layer 3: Is the discount pattern driven by category or price tier?

**Dimension tested:** Discount concentration across categories

| Category | Avg Discount | AOV Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Electronics | 15.0% | ₹57,809 (at 20–30% disc) vs ₹72,247 (at 0–10%) |
| Fashion | 15.0% | ₹54,419 (at 20–30%) vs ₹70,251 (at 0–10%) |
| Home | 15.0% | ₹56,048 (at 20–30%) vs ₹71,776 (at 0–10%) |

**Layer 3 finding:** Discounts are uniformly distributed across all categories (all at 15% avg). The impact is consistent: every category shows a ~22–25% AOV decline at the highest discount tier. This is a cross-category policy issue, not a category-specific one.

## Root Cause Statement

The ₹112.9M in foregone revenue during Jan–Feb 2026 is primarily explained by a discount policy that offers up to 30% reductions without elasticity-based justification. The 3,162 orders in the 20–30% discount tier account for 53% of all discounts given (₹60M) while generating the lowest AOV in the dataset (₹56,114). Critically, these orders show the same units per order (3.008) as zero-to-minimal-discount orders (3.013), confirming that high discounts are not driving incremental volume. This pattern is consistent across all three categories.

**Primary driver:** Over-discounting in the 20–30% range (no volume uplift, pure revenue erosion)
**Secondary driver:** Even the 10–20% tier shows declining AOV without volume gains — suggesting the discount ceiling could be tightened from 30% to 20% as an initial step

## Unexplained Variance

100% of the discount gap is explained by the discount policy. No additional unexplained variance.
