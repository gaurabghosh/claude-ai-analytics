## Hypothesis Table

| # | Hypothesis | Category | Prior Prob | Testability | Confirms If | Rejects If | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | High discounts are eroding revenue without driving volume | Supply/Product | 3 | 3 | AOV declines with discount rate; quantity stays flat | AOV stable across discount buckets OR quantity rises with discount | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| H2 | Electronics drives disproportionate revenue due to higher ASP | Supply/Product | 2 | 3 | Electronics AOV > other categories; revenue share > order share | Electronics has same AOV or lower revenue share | ✅ CONFIRMED (partially) |
| H3 | The February dip is a data artifact from a partial period | Data/Measurement | 3 | 3 | Daily average in Feb ≈ Jan; raw totals lower only because fewer days | Feb daily average also lower than Jan | ✅ CONFIRMED — Feb is partial (10 days) |
| H4 | High-unit-price items dominate revenue despite fewer orders | Demand/External | 2 | 3 | Premium+Luxury (>₹25K) = majority of revenue | Budget items (<₹10K) drive majority of revenue | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| H5 | Payment method drives different AOV or discount behavior | Demand/External | 2 | 3 | One payment method has significantly higher AOV or discount rate | All payment methods have similar AOV and discount rates | ❌ REJECTED — all payment methods near-identical |
| H6 | Delivery date anomalies (49% before order date) affect revenue metrics | Data/Measurement | 2 | 3 | Revenue totals change when excluding anomalous rows | Revenue analysis based on order_date is unaffected | ❌ REJECTED — revenue metrics use order_date; delivery dates not used |
| H7 | Certain states significantly outperform others on revenue | Mix/Composition | 2 | 3 | Top state has >3x the revenue of bottom state | States are roughly uniform | ❌ REJECTED — top-bottom spread is only 1.4x |
| H8 | The discount pattern differs across categories (Simpson's Paradox risk) | Mix/Composition | 2 | 3 | Some category shows rising AOV with higher discount | All categories show same declining AOV pattern | ❌ REJECTED — pattern is consistent across all 3 categories |

## Key Hypotheses Confirmed

**H1 (Primary):** Discounts are destroying revenue without driving volume. Quantity per order is statistically identical across all discount buckets (mean 3.01 units, max deviation 0.008 units). AOV declines 25.3% from lowest to highest discount tier.

**H4 (Secondary):** Premium + Luxury price tier (unit price >₹25K) accounts for 74.2% of total revenue despite comprising a minority of catalog. Budget segment (<₹10K) is only 4% of revenue.
