## Simpson's Paradox Check

**PASSED.** The relationship between discount rate and AOV is consistent across all three categories:

| Category | 0–10% Disc AOV | 10–20% Disc AOV | 20–30% Disc AOV | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Electronics | ₹72,247 | ₹65,675 | ₹57,809 | Declining ✅ |
| Fashion | ₹70,251 | ₹65,209 | ₹54,419 | Declining ✅ |
| Home | ₹71,776 | ₹62,185 | ₹56,048 | Declining ✅ |

No segment shows a trend opposing the aggregate. The discount-erodes-AOV story is robust.

## Key Findings Register

### F1: Discounts consumed ₹112.9M — 15% of gross revenue
- **Finding:** Amazon India gave ₹112.9M in discounts against ₹754.2M in gross revenue, retaining only 85.0%.
- **Magnitude:** ₹112.9M discount on ₹754.2M gross (15.0%)
- **Confidence:** High — calculated as unit_price × quantity × discount, independently verified
- **Hypothesis link:** Confirms H1
- **Needs more investigation:** No

### F2: Each discount tier reduces AOV by ~₹6–9K without moving unit volume
- **Finding:** AOV declines monotonically across discount buckets while quantity per order remains statistically flat at 3.01 units.
- **Magnitude:** AOV range: ₹74,224 (0–5% disc) to ₹55,456 (25–30% disc) = -25.3%
- **Magnitude (quantity):** 3.013 → 3.022 → 3.008 across discount buckets (max deviation: 0.008 units)
- **Confidence:** High — both metrics verified independently
- **Hypothesis link:** Confirms H1 (primary)
- **Needs more investigation:** No — the pattern is clear and consistent

### F3: Electronics leads revenue but margin is slim over other categories
- **Finding:** Electronics leads all three categories at 34.2% of revenue, but Home (33.4%) and Fashion (32.4%) are within 1.8 percentage points.
- **Magnitude:** Electronics ₹219.4M | Home ₹214.8M | Fashion ₹208.0M
- **Confidence:** High
- **Hypothesis link:** Partially confirms H2
- **Needs more investigation:** No

### F4: Within Electronics, Laptop and Mobile are neck-and-neck
- **Finding:** Laptop and Mobile split Electronics evenly (34% and 34% of Electronics revenue respectively).
- **Magnitude:** Laptop ₹74.7M | Mobile ₹74.3M | Accessories ₹70.4M
- **Confidence:** High
- **Hypothesis link:** Extends H2
- **Needs more investigation:** No

### F5: Furniture (₹111.8M) is the single largest sub-category by revenue
- **Finding:** Despite being in the lowest-AOV category bracket, Furniture leads all sub-categories due to high order volume (1,738 orders).
- **Magnitude:** ₹111.8M (17.4% of total)
- **Confidence:** High
- **Hypothesis link:** New finding
- **Needs more investigation:** No

### F6: Premium + Luxury price tiers account for 74.2% of revenue
- **Finding:** Orders with unit prices above ₹25,000 generate 74.2% of total revenue with above-average AOV (₹83K–₹115K).
- **Magnitude:** Premium (₹25K–₹40K): 38.5% of revenue; Luxury (>₹40K): 35.7% of revenue; Budget (<₹10K): 4.1%
- **Confidence:** High
- **Hypothesis link:** Confirms H4
- **Needs more investigation:** No

### F7: Opportunity — ₹39.1M revenue recovery from tightening discount ceiling
- **Finding:** If the 3,162 orders currently receiving 20–30% discounts were capped at 10%, revenue would increase by ₹39.1M (+6.1% on current ₹642M).
- **Magnitude:** ₹39.1M uplift (conservative — assumes same order volume, higher unit revenue)
- **Confidence:** Medium — assumes no volume loss from discount reduction
- **Hypothesis link:** Sizes H1
- **Needs more investigation:** Yes — volume elasticity unknown; this is an upper-bound estimate

### F8: Daily run rate declined 3.7% MoM on a daily-average basis
- **Finding:** Feb daily average (₹15.21M/day, 235 orders/day) is below Jan (₹15.81M/day, 247 orders/day), but Feb is only 10 days — insufficient to call a trend.
- **Magnitude:** -₹0.60M/day (-3.7%)
- **Confidence:** Low — partial period; do not use as a trend
- **Hypothesis link:** Confirms H3 (Feb dip is partial-period artifact)
- **Needs more investigation:** No — flagged as partial period; not in narrative
