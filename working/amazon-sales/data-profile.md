## Data Quality Issues

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 49.1% ship/delivery dates precede order_date | High | Ship/delivery analysis blocked | Use order_date only; exclude ship/delivery metrics |
| Product names are placeholder text | Medium | Product-level analysis impossible | Use sub_category instead of product_name |
| States are US states (country=India) | Medium | State-level geography unreliable | Flag in appendix; state analysis is directional only |
| Quantity distribution is perfectly uniform | Low | May indicate synthetic data | Acknowledge; does not affect revenue analysis |
| Payment method distribution is perfectly uniform | Low | May indicate synthetic data | Acknowledge; does not affect revenue analysis |
| Only one order_status value | Low | No funnel analysis possible | Scope to revenue analysis only |

## Data Readiness Verdict

**⚠️ Proceed with caution.**

The financial metrics (total_sales, unit_price, discount, quantity, shipping_cost) are internally consistent and reliable for revenue analysis. The total_sales formula verifies exactly.

**Blocked analyses:** Shipping/delivery time, returns analysis, geographic analysis at state level, product-level analysis.

**Cleared for analysis:** Total revenue, category/sub-category performance, discount impact on AOV, price tier segmentation, payment method split, daily order trends.
