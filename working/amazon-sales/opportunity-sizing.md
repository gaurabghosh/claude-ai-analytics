# Opportunity Sizing — Amazon India Sales

## Opportunity Definition

**Opportunity type:** Recovery (fix revenue erosion from over-discounting)
**Addressable population:** 3,162 orders currently receiving 20–30% discounts
**Time horizon:** Annualized from 41-day run rate (extrapolated)
**Metric that moves:** Average Order Value (AOV) and total revenue

## Opportunity 1: Cap Discount Ceiling at 10% for High-Discount Tier

### Base Case Calculation

**Current state (20–30% discount bucket):**
- Orders: 3,162 (in 41 days → 2,813/month run rate)
- Current AOV: ₹56,114
- Current revenue: ₹177.5M (in 41 days)
- Discount given: ₹60.0M

**If capped at 10% discount:**
- New AOV (recalculated): unit_price × quantity × 0.90 + shipping
- New revenue from same 3,162 orders: ₹216.6M
- Revenue uplift: +₹39.1M in 41 days

**Annualized (assuming same order rate):**
- Monthly uplift: ~₹28.7M/month
- Annual uplift: ~₹344M/year (if run rate holds)

*Note: This assumes zero volume elasticity — no orders are lost when discount is reduced. This is the upper-bound estimate.*

## Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | Assumption | Uplift (41-day period) | Annualized |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 40% of high-discount orders would not have placed the order at lower discount (volume loss) | ₹23.5M | ~₹206M |
| Base case | 15% volume loss — most demand is inelastic at these price points | ₹33.2M | ~₹292M |
| Optimistic | 0% volume loss — all demand is inelastic | ₹39.1M | ~₹344M |

**Biggest source of uncertainty:** Discount elasticity of the 20–30% tier. If customers in this tier are highly price-sensitive, volume loss could exceed the base case. A 30-day A/B test would resolve this.

## Opportunity 2: Reduce 10–20% Discount Tier to 5–10%

**Additional context:** The 10–20% tier also shows AOV erosion (₹64,342 vs ₹71,006 for 0–10% tier) with no volume uplift. Tightening this tier adds a second layer of recovery.

| Scenario | Uplift (41-day) |
|---|---|
| Conservative (25% volume loss) | ₹9.8M |
| Base case (10% volume loss) | ₹13.1M |
| Optimistic (0% volume loss) | ₹14.5M |

---

## Effort and Feasibility

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Effort to capture | Low — discount ceiling is a policy/system configuration change |
| Time to impact | Immediate — pricing changes take effect at order time |
| Dependencies | Requires pricing team and platform approval; A/B test recommended first |
| Key risk | Discount may be used competitively — reducing it could shift demand to competitors |

---

## Prioritization

| Opportunity | Base Case Impact | Confidence | Effort | Priority Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cap 20–30% → 10% | ₹33.2M (41-day) / ₹292M annualized | Medium | Low | **HIGH** |
| Tighten 10–20% → 5–10% | ₹13.1M (41-day) / ₹115M annualized | Medium | Low | **MEDIUM** |

## Opportunity Summary Cards

> **Opportunity 1:** Eliminate deep discounting (>20%) by capping at 10%
> **Size:** ₹23.5M–₹39.1M over 41 days (base case: ₹33.2M); ₹206M–₹344M annualized
> **Action required:** Update pricing policy to cap maximum discount at 10%; run 30-day A/B test to measure volume impact
> **Confidence:** Medium
> **Key assumption:** The demand generating 20–30% discount orders is not primarily discount-driven
