# Question Framing — Amazon India Sales Analysis

## Structured Analytical Question

Among all 10,000 orders placed on Amazon India between January 1 and February 10, 2026, total sales reached ₹642M. The question is: **What is driving revenue performance, and where is value being left on the table?** Specifically, we need to understand the role of discounting as a revenue driver — or destroyer — in order to decide whether the current discount strategy should be revised.

## Decision Context

- **Decision maker:** Head of Commercial / VP of Sales Strategy
- **Decision:** Should discount policy be revised — specifically, should high-discount tiers (20–30%) be capped or restructured?
- **What changes based on the answer:** Pricing and promotional strategy for Q2 2026
- **Cost of being wrong:** If we remove discounts that actually drive volume, we lose transactions. If we keep unnecessary discounts, we permanently erode revenue.

## Success Criteria

- Understand total revenue and its composition by category, sub-category, and price tier
- Quantify the revenue impact of the current discount strategy
- Test whether discounts drive incremental volume (quantity per order)
- Size the recovery opportunity if discount policy is tightened
- Output: a presentation deck with a clear recommendation

## Key Assumptions

1. **total_sales is the correct revenue metric.** Verified: total_sales = (unit_price × quantity × (1 − discount)) + shipping_cost. ✅
2. **All 10,000 orders are valid and complete.** No cancellations, returns, or partial orders exist in this dataset (all status = "Delivered").
3. **Discount rates are set at the time of order**, not retroactively applied. We treat them as policy decisions, not data artifacts.
4. **February data is partial** (Jan 1–Feb 10). MoM comparisons use daily averages, not raw totals.
5. **The dataset is representative of the broader business.** No selection filters are known to have been applied.

## Data Quality Flags (Pre-Analysis)

| Issue | Severity | Impact on Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| 49.1% of deliveries before order date | High | Delivery metrics unusable; revenue analysis unaffected |
| Product names are placeholders ("without", "school", "I") | Medium | Brand/product analysis limited; category analysis valid |
| Country = "India" but states are US states | Low | Geographic analysis limited to state-level only |
| Only one order_status = "Delivered" | Low | No funnel or conversion analysis possible |

## Suggested Analytical Approach

1. **Descriptive Analytics:** Baseline revenue, category mix, sub-category breakdown
2. **Discount Impact Analysis:** AOV by discount bucket, quantity vs. discount
3. **Price Tier Analysis:** Revenue by unit price tier
4. **Opportunity Sizing:** Revenue recovery if discount policy tightened
5. **Story:** Discount erosion narrative with actionable recommendation
